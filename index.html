                     <h3>About Omar</h3>
                        <p>I currently work in IT as a Network Engineer for a Construction Company in NY/NJ. 
                            I am taking time off for the birth of my wife and I's first child. 
                            I plan to use this time away from work to bond with my family as well
                             as learn and hone new skills that will help me further advance in the technology world. </p>
                             <br>
                        <p>The world of technology has always amazed me. 
                            I have had a love for computers from a young age.
                        Being that I come from a family of engineers, 
                        I have always been challenged
                         to question how things work and to solve problems.</p>
